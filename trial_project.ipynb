If Israel can illegally possess nuclear weapons (they haven't officially acknowledge they have nuclear weapons, nor have they signed the UN's non-proliferation treaty, making the weapons they do possess illegal), why can't Iran possess nuclear weapons, other than Western bias?

Iran has proven itself to be a pragmatic and rational actor in world affairs. There is no reason to suspect that they would actually use a nuclear weapon, nor sell it to a terrorist group who would. They mainly want a nuclear weapon to secure their military position in the region, stick it to their rivals, and as a point of national pride.
